# 4. Gantry

The gantry comes pre-assembled with printed parts in PLA that are for **transportation only**. Please remove these parts and replace them with your own, printed parts as you see fit.

All LDO rails are from factory, and should also be cleaned and lubricated. It is also adviced to verify MGN12 Y rails for proper aligment using the [MGN12 alignment tool][].

## Video tutorial

The video tutorial below depicts the Vz235 (smaller printer) AWD configuration, but may still be useful to those building a 2WD kit. Many of the Vz235 aspects are scaled down things from the Vz330.
