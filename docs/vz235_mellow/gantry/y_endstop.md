## Instructions

1. Mount the D2F switch to the Y-axis endstop bracket using 2 `M2x10mm screws` as such that:

   * The bracket's large mounting tab with the large mounting hole is pointing up and away from you
   * The switch's lever pointing to the right and up.

    Or as shown:

2. Mount the assembled Y-axis endstop to the rail using 1 `M4x8mm screw` and 1 `M4 T-nut`.

    The Y-axis endstop is mounted front-left, immediately behind the left-side motor mount.
