## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where do I create an order?

Orders are handled through an automated system hosted on the VzBoT Community Discord server. Please join the [VzBoT Discord server](https://discord.gg/vzbot) and see the [Customer guide](/ezvz/how-it-works/customers) for steps on creating an order.

### How does payment work?

Payment is handled by the customer and provider parties. The VzBoT team does not handle, mediate or facilitate any kind of transfer of funds ("payment"), and does not hold itself accountable to overseeing this transaction.

### What happens if I get scammed?

In the event that you are dissatisfied with the service you've been provided and cannot come to an agreement with the provider (or cannot contact the provider), please contact the VzBoT team.  
We will do our best to try and find a solution.

If a customers scams you as a provider (e.g. by not paying after shipping) please also contact the VzBoT team.

### What happens if a provider revokes my order?

If a provider should revoke or cancel your order after accepting the deal, a note will be left on their provider profile and be visible to other customers.
