# Print Rules for Application

When applying you need to print a [VzCube](https://github.com/VzBoT3D/VzBoT-Vz330/blob/master/Assemblies%20BOM%20and%20STL/Print%20Test/VzCube.stl) and show us the pictures of all 6 sides.

You can see the allowed filaments and the required print settings [here](/ezvz/filaments).

## Forbidden Filaments

Filaments which include glitter or cf filaments are not allowed for the application because they can hide printing artifacts.  
**These are only forbidden when applying, later in while processing orders these kind of filaments are allowed**

## Pictures

The pictures must show:

1. All six sides of the printed cube
2. The light should be neutral and coming from the front.
3. Use calipers on all 3 axis (x, y, z) to show us dimensional accuracy.
