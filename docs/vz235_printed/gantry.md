# 3. Gantry

## Overview

![Gantry](../assets/images/manual/vz235_printed/gantry/overview.png)
<br/>

The Gantry is configurable for an AWD version and a 2WD version. The only difference between the two configurations is the rear idler mounts. On AWD they have an additional Nema 17 integrated in the design.
