## Instructions

1. Solder the Y-axis endstop wires to the Common and Normally Closed (NC) pins of the microswitch. Use heatshrink to insulate the contacts.  
    *Optionally, remove the middle (NO) contact's pin with flush cutters or sidecutters.*

2. Mount the D2F switch to the Y-axis endstop bracket using 2 `M2x10mm screws` as such that:

   * The bracket's large mounting tab with the large mounting hole is pointing up and away from you
   * The switch's lever pointing to the right and up.

    Or as shown:

3. Mount the assembled Y-axis endstop to the rail using 1 `M4x8mm screw` and 1 `M4 T-nut`.

    The Y-axis endstop is mounted front-left, immediately behind the left-side motor mount.
