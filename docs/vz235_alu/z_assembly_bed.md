# 2. Z - Assembly & Bed

## Overview

![Z Overview](../assets/images/manual/vz235_alu/z_assembly/overview.png)

The proper alignment procedure of the Vz235 is the same as on the Vz330 only difference is the length of the alignment tools. Make sure to check out the YouTube video explaining how to align your Z-assembly, so it is both smooth and lines up with the possible travel of the printhead.
