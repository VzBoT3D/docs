# VzBoT235 - Aluminium Version

![Overview](../assets/images/manual/vz235_alu/alu_preview.png)

Vz235 is the smaller brother of the original [VzBot 330 - Printed Version](../vz330_printed) / [VzBot 330 - Mellow Kit](../vz330_mellow) 3D-printer. With its
relatively small build volume, it has reduced weight and a smaller form factor. The design
is built around the popular Creality Ender 3 bed, but is not limited to this size: the
frame can be scaled up or down to fit the individual builder's requirements.

This build differs from the [Vz235 - Printed Version](../vz235_printed) just in the part that gantry and z-assembly is replaced by manufactured aluminium pieces.

On how to print the files for this printer please refer to [print settings](../general/misc-info/print-settings)
