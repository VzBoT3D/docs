To sync the belts properly it is important that the rear motor pulleys are attached without the grubscrews facing the flat part of the shaft. One can also use a motor with a round shaft instead of a D shaped shaft. Before tightening one needs to loosen the set screws on both of the rear motor pulleys to get a proper reading of the tension. After tensioning you will need to power on the motors so they are engaged thus on a step position. You can now retighten the grubscrews again making sure the screws are not at the flat side of the shaft, turn the motor shaft if needed. In the sample pinter.cfg file there is a macro included that enables all XY motors for synchronizing the belts. Make sure to have the pulleys and stepper shafts in a good position so they can be reached easily. ",

Since this era, the VzBoT project has come very far. From Aluminum CNC parts to a full kit (soon) and custom high performance hotend, the project has developed at a lightning pace to be one of the fastest printers out there. The printers . Originally, the VZ project started with a VZ330 by Simon Vez. Recently, Guillaume has developed his iteration of the VzBoT. This printer aims to address a few compromises with the larger sized printer, by using a 235x235 bed size (ender 3 sized). This makes sourcing the parts for this printer relatively easy. Combined with the AWD functionality (all wheel drive, 2 motors on X and 2 on Y) and shorter belt loops, this printer is for those who thrive to be the fastest. ",

    "title": "What is AWD (All wheel drive)?",
    "content": "In conventional CoreXY machines, a 2WD setup is used. This setup utilizes 2 stepper motors at the back or front of the machine. Recently, the VzBoT project has adapted the AWD setup! This setup utilizes 2 motors on X, and 2 on Y, doubling the amount of motors for the XY plane. What are the advantages of this setup? Let’s go over them: . | Having two motors on one belt allows for a shorter effective belt length. This leads to less belt stretch, which usually gives better input shaper results. | The maximum useable acceleration is about 1.5x higher compared to 2WD due to the added torque. | . We recommend using the LDO-42STH48-2504AC or 2504AH 1.8° motors, as they give the best performance for the VzBoT’s usecase. ",

To see the recommended print settings please refere here. Step 1 . To start you are going to build the 2 sides of your frame. Make sure you do your building on a nice flat surface. You will lay your frame half down with the included printed alignment tools for the y gantry extrusions and hand tighten all blind joints. After hand tightening you can start tightening everything down properly. Make sure every corner is exactly 90 degrees. Moreover, make sure the Y gantry extrusion is parallel to the upper and lower extrusion of the frame half. The Y gantry extrusion is the only extrusion that can’t use a 2020 corner joint bracket, it is stabilized by the motormount so there is no need for extra reinforcement. Once you are done with one half repeat for the other half. Check the two halves by laying them on top of each other with all corners exactly in the same spot and check the y gantry extrusions for the two halves whether they are parallel to each other. They need to be parallel for the printer to operate smoothly. It’s important to make sure the y-gantry is the same height. Step 2 . The bottom, top and upright extrusions in the front of the frame all have printed nut inserts inserted. 2 in the top for the door latches, 2 in the bottom for the lower latches and 1 in upright for the motor mounts to attach to. Insert the M4 nuts into the M4 inserts and push them in the uprights on the frame half. Next insert the 2x5mm magnets and the m3 nut into the frame part of the magnetic door latches and put 2 in the front lower and 2 in the front upper extrusion as shown in the picture before assembling the final part of the frame. Step 3 . Attach the extrusions to connect the two halves of the frame. Make sure to put the part you are assembling on the flat surface and afterwards check the frame on squareness. Step 4 . Attach all corner joints and check if your frame is square and strong. After this checks out attach the handles and the frame is built. ",

On how to print the files for this printer please refer to print settings .

Using the alignment tool, mount the MGN12 to the frame like shown below: . Use the 8mm M3 screws and T-nuts. You don’t need to fill all holes, but any other hole is fine. Make sure they are perfectly centered to the 2020 extrusion . Step 2 . Mount the lower half of the printed Y gantry pieces to their MGN12 cart with the 10mm M3 screws. Make sure the y gantry piece is parallel to the linear rail on both sides, you can use a small spirit level to achieve this. Step 3 . To drill the holes in your CF-tube you’ll need to measure out where all holes will need, to do this the following is recommended: put a piece of painter’s tape on the tube, put the MGN9 on the tube with the alignment tools and have it centered. use a pencil to mark out all the holes you want to use. Put the CF-tube in your gantry and mark the holes for the tube to connect to the Y gantry, you will only need the 30mm M3 screws to secure the tube, the holes in the side are for 2020 extrusions. !warning! drilling and sawing carbon fiber is very hazardous, if you don’t buy the predrilled tube from mellow or the aluminum tube from F3D’s shop be careful. Wear protection and drill in wet surfaces! . Step 4 . Mount the rail on the CF-tube using the alignment tools and the 8mm M3 screws, use the M3 insert piece to hold the M3 nuts and remove this printed holder after mounting. Step 5 . Insert the endcaps in the CF-tube and put the tube in the Y gantry brackets, add the top part of the Y gantry and their corresponding hardware. Don’t forget to add the printed X end stop part on top of the left Y gantry. Keep all hardware on this point finger tight. Step 6 . Insert the idlers and M5 bolts and nuts to secure, again only finger tight . Step 7 . Put the x gantry against the rear idlers and tighten the Y gantry M3 hardware that hold the CF-tube in place. Then tighten the M5 hardware that hold the idlers, now your X gantry should be parallel to your rear extrusion. Measure with calipers to verify. ",

Do make sure the brackets are on the most outer position of the frame like shown below and that they are flat with the frame. Do not attach the printer bed to the frame yet. Step 2 . Attach all rod holders finger tight (upper &amp; lower) to the frame, don’t worry about the position just yet. You want to be able to shift them around. Then insert the rods into the bearings and attach the bed frame with the rods to the respective rod holders. Step 3 . With the assembly in place attach the two alignment tools like shown below and tighten . Step 4 . Once you aligned the front corners you are going to put the bed in the lowest position and wiggle the bed around. Try to get the rod pretty nice and vertical to the frame and tighten the rear bottom rod holders and tighten them to the frame. Step 5 . Now put the bed in the highest position and tighten the clamps for the upper rods and tighten the brackets to the frame. To keep the bed up you can use zip ties or ask someone to help. Step 6 . Insert the bearings in the leadscrew brackets (press fit) and attach the brackets like shown below. Don’t forget to put the belt around the pulley before assembling the top part of the bracket. Then attach the leadscrew support with the oldham couplers and leadscrew nut to the bed frame and assemble the parts loosely. Step 7 . To align the parts, measure the bracket is nicely in between the rod holders measure the distance and get it approximately centered. Turn the leadscrew a bit to help it self-align the upper leadscrew support on the bed and tighten the parts. The leadscrew should be nice and vertical. To check you can put the bed in the highest position and measure the distances between the leadscrew and z rod. The leadscrew should now be centered between both z rods. Step 8 . Attach the single motor mount like shown below . The top M3 screws are 30mm and lock the sliding mechanism in place. They also serve as reinforcement of the mount. Also attach the motor pulley and belt on the motor. Step 9 . To synchronize the leadscrews, turn out the grub screws on the 40t pulleys and get the bed in the top position. Then retighten the grubscrews . Step 10 . Assemble the z switch and make sure when the bed rises the switch is triggered by the screw to avoid a bed crash at the first homing sequence. Step 11 . Finally install the bed M3 supports, attach the bed with the countersunk M3’s and bed springs.
